  PrologueTextDescription: "It is said that history becomes legend as its events recede
    into the mists of time and that memories grow dimmer in the slumber of peace.
    Thus, the noble people of Atmos languished in thousand years of peaceful splendor
    and forget the dark times they lived once. \r\nBut the evil, never forgot.\r\nSo
    Eligos, the god of death, rise from the darkness once again to release an ancient
    evil sealed long time ago. Consuming and corrupting every greed heart, Elios will
    seek all decay living being to bring back his champion once more.\r\nNow, Atmos's
    fate is uncertain as a shadowy hand rest on it\r."

  IntroTextDescriptions:
  - "Regulos, the bright jewel of Atmos. \r\nA place for order where science and magic
    walk together. Among so many places in Regulos the most notorious, without a doubt,
    is the Arcane Academy. \r\nThere, many talented minds study the mysteries of the
    science of magic.\r\nYou are Arkantus, one of these students. Not so smart or
    gifted, you would not even be there if it were the kindness of Kalimari, the headmaster
    of the Arcane Academy.\r\n"
  - You are concentrated performing advanced alchemy experiments. There is a lot of
    research to be done and many of them were commissioned by the headmaster himself,
    Kalimari. The artifact you are examining is intriguing. Its resonance seems to
    nullify the magical properties of everything around him; it seems to be broken,
    as if some part of it were missing. After hours of research nothing seems made
    the artifact react to your experiments. Thus, the real property of this mysterious
    artifact remains unknown.
