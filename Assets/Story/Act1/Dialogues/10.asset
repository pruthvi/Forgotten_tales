  TextDescription: You arrive quickly in the headmaster's office, something strange
    is happening. You did not find anyone on the way. When you open the door, the
    room is empty. There is nobody. There is a large window in the headmaster's room,
    through it you see several flaming points going in the direction of the Arcane
    Academy. They are huge fireballs! What are you going to do?
