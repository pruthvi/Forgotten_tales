  TextDescription: "Your maneuver saves your life, but there\u2019s lots of smoke
    and wreckage on all sides. Somebody appears and quickly pulls you before another
    ball of fire hits you. He speaks:\r\n- Quick, Arkantus. I was sent by Kalimari
    to rescue you, we have a lot of things to discuss, there is no time to lose. Let\u2019s
    go! So, we can safely escape.\n\nAway from all this confusion you see the Arcane
    Academy burning in flames, hit by powerful and forbidden magic. There is no sign
    of who is responsible for this or how many people have been injured in this nefarious
    attack. You and your ally arrive in a tavern almost on the edge of town. There
    you find the injured headmaster Kalimari and also find another mysterious figure.\r\nA
    few hours ago everything was in peace and now by a twist of fate everything will
    never be the same....\r"
