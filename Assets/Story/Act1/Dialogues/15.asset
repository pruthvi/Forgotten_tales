  TextDescription: "The mysterious figure helps you remove the stones blocking your
    path. He introduces himself:\r\n-Arkantus, are you okay? My name is Kivan, the
    headmaster Kalimari sent me to rescue you. There is a lot to be discussed and
    there is no time to waste. Let's go! \r\nTogether you both go to the exit. Already
    at the final gate there is a huge pile of fire.\r\nIs the fire pile seeming to
    be approaching?\r\nWait! It's not a pile of fire, it's a fire elemental! Get ready
    for combat! (if the player win go to 15A)\r\n"
