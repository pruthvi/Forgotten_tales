  TextDescription: "After an arduous battle, you finally get out of this place.\n\nAway
    from all this confusion you see the Arcane Academy burning in flames, hit by powerful
    and forbidden magic. There is no sign of who is responsible for this or how many
    people have been injured in this nefarious attack. You and your ally arrive in
    a tavern almost on the edge of town. There you find the injured headmaster Kalimari
    and also find another mysterious figure.\r\nA few hours ago everything was in
    peace and now by a twist of fate everything will never be the same....\r"
