  DialogueText: Your room is destroyed; a horrible and nauseating smell is in the
    air. Your research and the mysterious artifact are gone. They left absolutely
    nothing. You have a terrible feeling. Who could be interested in this artifact
    to the point of doing so? You need to make a decision right now. What are you
    going to do?
