  TextDescription: You quickly shelter yourself under the table when a big explosion
    hits the room. The Arcane Academy is under attack. Part of the ceiling collapses
    on top of your desk, trapping you underneath it. Someone enters the room and calls
    your name as I've been looking for you, worried. The person seems injured. What
    are you going to do?
