  TextDescription: "Away from all this confusion you see the Arcane Academy burning
    in flames, hit by powerful and forbidden magic. There is no sign of who is responsible
    for this or how many people have been injured in this nefarious attack. You and
    your ally arrive in a tavern almost on the edge of town. There you find the injured
    headmaster Kalimari and also find another mysterious figure.\r\nA few hours ago
    everything was in peace and now by a twist of fate everything will never be the
    same....\r"
