  TextDescription: After a few minutes something violently breaks your window, and
    three spheres fall on the floor and then they explode, spreading a gray smoke,
    spit with horrible smell. You feel dizzy and you see someone in front of you.
    And that person is heading for your table. What are you going to do?
