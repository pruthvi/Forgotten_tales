  DialogueText: "You quickly pull the magic scroll and read the spell written. There
    is something different about this magic, as if someone interfered with its execution.
    You are surrounded by the magic of teleportation and disappear.\r\nWhen you reappear,
    you are at the entrance to the academy. A man in front of you with a magical scroll
    too. He introduces himself\r\n\"Hello Arkantus. My name is Kivan, I was sent by
    Kalimari to make sure you got safely out of this hell.\" There is much to be discussed
    and there is no time to lose, everything will be explained. Let's go!"
