  TextDescription: "You quickly pull the magic scroll and read the spell written.
    There is something different about this magic, as if someone interfered with its
    execution. You are surrounded by the magic of teleportation and disappear.\nWhen
    you reappear, you are at the entrance to the academy. A man in front of you with
    a magical scroll too. He introduces himself\r\n\"Hello Arkantus. My name is Kivan,
    I was sent by Kalimari to make sure you got safely out of this hell.\" There is
    much to be discussed and there is no time to lose, everything will be explained.
    Let's go!\n\nAway from all this confusion you see the Arcane Academy burning in
    flames, hit by powerful and forbidden magic. There is no sign of who is responsible
    for this or how many people have been injured in this nefarious attack. You and
    your ally arrive in a tavern almost on the edge of town. There you find the injured
    headmaster Kalimari and also find another mysterious figure.\r\nA few hours ago
    everything was in peace and now by a twist of fate everything will never be the
    same....\r"
