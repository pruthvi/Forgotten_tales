  TextDescription: "You quickly pull the magic scroll and read the spell written.
    There is something different about this magic, as if someone interfered with its

    you reappear, you are at the entrance to the academy. A man in front of you with
    a magical scroll too. He introduces himself\r\n\"Hello Arkantus. My name is Kivan,
    I was sent by Kalimari to make sure you got safely out of this hell.\" There is
    much to be discussed and there is no time to lose, everything will be explained.
